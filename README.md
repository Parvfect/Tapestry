I’m writing this sat in the AirBNB, the day before my Graduation. I am finding now that I can’t seem to write anymore, and although I’m training enough and well, and seeing really good positive results, I am slacking on a general basis in the discipline in the other aspects of my life. I’m confused as to how I should choose to intepret this condition however. Adding to this, the vast difference between my lifestyle and the ordinary person is starting to widen and become more heavily apparent, which - although reassuring that I’m approaching a life of my design, is concerning - for no hand can lead me down to the river. Relationships are rare and in between, and there is no attempt from me to try to explain myself or what I am doing, although I am relatively clear on what I am doing. 

Or am I? 

The thing I am clear about is what I’m striving to achieve, which is to be a Professional Cricketer. What has changed is the fact that I’m approaching it with the frame of mind that I’ll do it even if I don’t succeed, because the process itself and what it will make me into - is worth it. I know that if I’m pursuing this dream with all my stake in it, the other parts of my life converge to the right things that I want, because I know I am chasing something that is so meaningful. Along with this, a stable career, and seeking to be a great Individual is another part of the story, and what I currently understand about it is that I need to do well in my Masters (which I know I will if I enjoy the Project) and work towards creating the right connections and profile to get into DeepMind - which has also been a long term goal of mine. 

Now that I think about it, a lot of these things I’ve been chasing for a long time, and overall the general gist of what I want from my life has not altered, rather, it’s the conviction of the spirit that has changed. I feel like I chased these things without understanding before, just for a chance to be able to breath in the same air, and now I truly understand it. As much as it is a gift, and an opporutnity, it is a responsiblity and a dependence. The relationship is completely Symbiotic in nature. Because I’m so far along the journey, as much as I want to do it and aspire to do it, it has become the sole centre of my identity, and without it there is a definite state of confusion. 

It’s hard to be able to explain it clearly without having to resign towards metaphors. But influences and what ‘normal’ comprises of is created through a mixture of inputs in your life, which you can efffectively control to tailor the life you want. The thing is, the majority of people don’t do this. They strive for control in certain aspects of life, but let go in most others. There is no need to be so deliberate about everything. This creates a growing pool of Novelty and seemingly Uncontrollable features that define your Identity, a much easier path than formulating it and then choosing to live it. For once you decide to do something like that, you need to commit yourself all the way, because there is nothing in between. 

And that is the tough part. You can have one or the Other. You can’t walk away with both.

The thing that is True for all cases in my Opinion is that there is no fundamentally right way to live. It’s all just justificaiton. This level of control allows me to live a Deliberate life to minimise Regret, but takes away the -things that happen to you- aspect of life, because it is centered so solely on your decisions and actions, since things don’t affect you as much anymore. It’s definitely different, but the biggest problem is losing conviction. Nothing else is more dangerous than that. Losing faith in the Process. 

The Process - but the Process of what?

Is it the Process to become some Individual that is at the pinnacle of what you are trying to achieve? Is it based on an end result? Are some Processes better than others? Why should there be a need to improve yourself, and at it’s core - is it even Fundamental? Or comprised of a set of other byproducts being pandered towards as a result of this seeking to become the Best version nonsense? What is the Point?

I’m afraid I have no answer to that one yet. Maybe a part of it is the element of blind conviction, Faith against Odds, that the dots connect. Maybe that’s just the best strategy given the circumstances. Maybe our Unconcsious Mind and the ‘Instinct’ and feel is catered towards guiding us towards maximal Achievment in life. 

Or maybe,

Train has now been cancelled, so I have about an one hour delay at minimum before I can think of going anywhere. Right, time to get some momentum on the writing aspect of things.

**Proactivity**

If you are responsible for your wins, your victories and what you have become, then you are also responsible for all your shortcomings, all your failures and your position in life. The advantage that complete responsibility will give you is well of two things. One is that it frees you up and maximises the things in your control. The moment you decide that something else was responsible for a thing that affects you, you lose aspects of control to this thing, and it becomes in charge, and you, a mere observer. Part two is that you understand that it gives you power, so much power. It frees you up to finally be able to live the life you want, because, the only thing that has responsibility is you and nothing can take that away from you. Nothing. 

Nothing external can ever beat the internal. 

******************************************Evolutionary Theories and their implications******************************************

Right, this is a very powerful idea so I need you to focus on this one. It goes back to how things work and why things are the way they are. The Natural approach, what can be interpreted as (the objectively) right way of things, or the correct way or the (minimum energy) state, is not how things are how they are. An evolutionary theory is a much better explanation of the way things are. Which means random chance and survival of the fittest set of organisms (yada yada), I’m not going to get into that, but the point is this. An example is well suited to explain this. 

Let’s think about my situation to put things into perspective. I want to be able to bowl a ball at 90 miles an hour. Now it’s an extremely rare thing in general that a person can bowl a ball that fast - a combination of factors that are common in high ball velocity athletes is of course - the right biomechanics, coupled with superior motor qualities, athletic ability and a high fast twitch fibre composition. But here’s the question, can we then say with complete composure that if one does not have the capability to build any of these buckets, that we can ascertain for sure that they would not be able to bowl a ball at that velocity - is there an upper bound to his athletic performance? Do we know that for sure?

And here we go back to the beginning. What we know is based on what has already happened. What we think we know about what it takes to perform at that level is based on how things are and always have been, which if it were to be (objectively correct) would be the right way to judge the future. However, the right understanding is one of the evolutionary theory - things are the way they are because of chance favouring certain phenotypes to behave and excel in certain ways.
